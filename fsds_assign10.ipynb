        "## 1. How do you distinguish between `shutil.copy()` and `shutil.copytree()`?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "- `shutil.copy(src, dest)` is used to copy a single file from the source (`src`) to the destination (`dest`).\n",
        "- `shutil.copytree(src, dest)` is used to copy an entire directory tree from the source (`src`) to the destination (`dest`), including all of its contents.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. What function is used to rename files?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "To rename files, you can use the `os.rename(old_name, new_name)` function. This function takes the current name (`old_name`) of the file and the desired new name (`new_name`) as arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the `send2trash` and `shutil` modules?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "- `send2trash` module provides a safer way to delete files by sending them to the operating system's trash or recycle bin instead of permanently deleting them.\n",
        "- `shutil` module provides functions like `shutil.rmtree()` to permanently delete files and directories. It doesn't use the operating system's trash.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. `ZipFile` objects have a `close()` method just like File objects’ `close()` method. What `ZipFile` method is equivalent to File objects’ `open()` method?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "The `ZipFile` method equivalent to File objects’ `open()` method is `ZipFile(file_path, 'w')`. This is used to create a new ZIP file or overwrite an existing one. It's similar to opening a file for writing.\n",
