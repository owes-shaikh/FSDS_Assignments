        "### Answer:\n",
        "Logging provides a more flexible and configurable way to manage output. You can easily control the verbosity of messages by adjusting the logging level, and it allows you to redirect messages to different outputs (e.g., console, file) without modifying your code.\n",

        "- **Step In (`F7`):** Executes the current line of code and stops at the first line of any function that is called.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "A breakpoint is a designated point in your code where the debugger will pause execution, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the program's state at that specific point."
