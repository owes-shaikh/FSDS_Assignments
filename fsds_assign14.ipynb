        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color model that represents colors in digital images, where the alpha channel represents the level of transparency.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "You can use the `getpixel()` method from the Pillow module to get the RGBA values of any pixel in an image.\n",

        "## 3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "A box tuple is a tuple containing four integers representing the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates of a rectangular region in an image. It defines a box or an area within an image.\n",

        "```python\n",
        "from PIL import Image\n",

        "# Get the width and height\n",
        "width, height = image.size\n",

        "## 5. What method would you call to get an Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "cropped_image = image.crop((0, 0, 50, 50))\n",
        "```\n",

        "## 6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n",

        "```python\n",
        "# Assuming 'modified_image' is the modified Image object\n",

        "## 7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "The shape-drawing code in Pillow is contained in the `ImageDraw` module.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "The `ImageDraw` object has drawing methods. You can get an `ImageDraw` object by calling the `ImageDraw.Draw()` function, passing it the Image object you want to draw on."
